              Iâ€™m Sandra, a Software developer based in Essex. I began learning
              to code at the beginning of 2022 and found the process of learning
              new technologies and creating solutions to difficult problems both
              exciting and rewarding. My long-term goal is to be able to
              efficiently turn great ideas into functioning products thorough
              absorbing as much as I can from those my senior and become the
              best developer I can be. In my spare time I like to swim and watch
              TV and movies.
